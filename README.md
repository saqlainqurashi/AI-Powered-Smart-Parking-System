This project implements a Smart Parking System using AI and computer vision techniques. The system uses cameras (or image input) to:

ðŸŽ¯ Detect parking alignment â€“ Identify whether a vehicle is parked correctly or incorrectly.

ðŸš— Track occupancy â€“ Detect parked vehicles and calculate the number of available slots.

ðŸ“Š Real-time updates â€“ Display the remaining available spaces on a dashboard.

ðŸ”” Alerts/Notifications â€“ Provide warnings in case of wrong parking or slot violations.

The goal is to improve parking efficiency, reduce congestion, and support smart city infrastructure.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack (example)

Python â€“ Main programming language

OpenCV / TensorFlow / YOLO â€“ For object detection & classification

Flask / FastAPI â€“ For backend API (optional)

n8n / Node-RED (optional) â€“ For automation workflows

Database (MySQL / Firebase) â€“ To store parking data

Frontend Dashboard â€“ To display available slots

ðŸ”¹ Potential Use Cases

Mall or commercial parking lots

Smart city IoT integration

University or corporate campuses

Automated valet & parking assistance
